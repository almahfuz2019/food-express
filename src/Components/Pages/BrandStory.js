Bashundhara Tissue, the pioneer Tissue Brand of Bashundhara Paper Mills Ltd., was launched during May 2000 amidst a situation where people of Bangladesh were least conscious about personal hygiene due to expensive available means or lack of collective awareness. Bashundhara Tissue emerged as a light of hope, gradually spanned throughout every corner of Bangladesh – with its superior absorbent & soft texture, affordability, availability and not the least having specific message “Think Hygiene, Live Safe”, very much inspired from its parent Bashundhara Group’s motto “For the People, For the Country”.

Today, Bashundhara Tissue is quite visible in every nook & corner of Bangladesh, be it a small Tong to luxury Department Store, thanks to its nationwide distribution network of over 350 exclusive & dedicated distributors and relentless production at enormous capacity world-class facility plant.

Bashundhara Tissue has been communicated in both ATL and BTL as the most caring Tissue brand in Bangladesh, esp. in 2020 the brand has celebrated its 20 years of passionate journey of Love & Care. Apart from various communication presences, Trade Scheme (annual), CP offers, campaigns, targeted promotion (regional & institutional) etc. run throughout the year to give the most to its consumers as well as channel partners. The vibrant & leading presence in the domestic market has paved the brand to excel in the International Arena, where currently the Tissue products in the Bulk form are being exported across continents, covering over 20 countries.

Like its present status, the future is also quite beaming where the positioning of Bashundhara Tissue has been projected as the most preferred Hygienic Lifestyle brand in South-East Asia in next 5 years, through the wider product line, attractive new style packs and attachment with different social segments. It all started with a commitment to provide hygienic management of lifestyle, however, the Bashundhara Tissue brand is still enthralled with its same brand promise, to help Bangladesh live on a hygienic and safe living.
